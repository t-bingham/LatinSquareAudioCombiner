# File Combiner for Audio Testing

This project is built using python 3.7.3

_**How to use**_

For testing, place the video files you want to combine into a single file *into the "Videos" directory.* When run, the program will ask you to name the CSV file. This file will be saved into the *"CSV" directory* and stores the Latin square which is used to randomise the audio file orders.

_**Note **_

There will be dependancies you need to download in order for this to work, notably pydub and audiosegment but possibly also others.
